# ForemWebView - iOS/macOS

This is the repo for the WKWebView customization that powers the Forem and DEV mobile apps

## Requirements

The Project supports iOS 13.x but features like Picture in Picture are only available for iPhones on iOS 14.x

## Installation

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate ForemWebView into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:

```
github "ForemWebView ~> 0.1"
```

Then use [the recommended steps to include the framework in your project](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).

## Picture in Picture video

In order for your app to support PiP you'll need to configure two more things:
1. Add the `Audio, Airplay, and Picture in Picture` Capability in your Project's Target
1. Configure the AVAudioSession category to `.playback`, preferrably in your AppDelegate. A one liner that works for this is `try? AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(.playback)`

## Contributing

1. Fork and clone the project.
1. Create a branch, naming it either a feature or bug: git checkout -b feature/that-new-feature or bug/fixing-that-bug
1. Code and commit your changes. Bonus points if you write a [good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/): git commit -m 'Add some feature'
1. Push to the branch: git push origin feature/that-new-feature
1. Create a pull request for your branch üéâ
