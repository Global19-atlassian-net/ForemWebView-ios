# ForemWebView - iOS/macOS

This is the WKWebView customization that powers the Forem (coming soon) and [DEV](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/DEV-ios) mobile apps.

## Requirements

The Project supports iOS 13.x but features like Picture in Picture are only available for iPhones on iOS 14.x

## Installation

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate ForemWebView into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:

```
github "ForemWebView ~> 0.1"
```

Then use [the recommended steps to include the framework in your project](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).

#### Swift Package Manager & CocoaPods

Not yet supported. If interested in contributing, PRs for these are welcome!

## Features / Public interface

Initialize the ForemWebView and treat it as if it were just another WKWebView. An example project is available in this repo.

```swift
webView.navigationDelegate = self
webView.foremWebViewDelegate = self

// Our custom `load(_ urlString: String)` function
webView.load("https://dev.to")

// Once a page is loaded via `.load(...)` the `baseHost` variable
// will remain available for future use
print(webView.baseHost)
```

You're in charge of the `navigationPolicy`, but we provide a few helper methods like `isOAuthUrl` which will help make these decisions. The current interface supports:

- `load(_ urlString: String)` -> Recommended interface for programmatically loading a URL in the webView
- `isOAuthUrl(_ url: URL) -> Bool` -> Responds to whether the url provided is one of the supported 3rd party redirect URLs in a OAuth protocol
- `fetchUserStatus(completion: @escaping (String?) -> Void)` -> Async callback to request the user status (i.e. `logged-in`)
- `fetchUserData(completion: @escaping (ForemUserData?) -> Void)` -> Async callback to request the `ForemUserData` struct

## Picture in Picture video

In order for your app to support PiP you'll need to configure two more things:
1. Add the `Audio, Airplay, and Picture in Picture` Capability in your Project's Target
1. Configure the AVAudioSession category to `.playback`, preferrably in your AppDelegate. A one liner that works for this is `try? AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(.playback)`
