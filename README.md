# ForemWebView - iOS/macOS

This is the WKWebView customization that powers the Forem (coming soon) and [DEV](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/DEV-ios) mobile apps.

## Requirements

The Project supports iOS 13.x but features like Picture in Picture are only available for iPhones on iOS 14.x

## Installation

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate ForemWebView into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:

```
github "ForemWebView ~> 0.1"
```

Then use [the recommended steps to include the framework in your project](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).

#### Swift Package Manager & CocoaPods

Not yet supported. If interested in contributing, PRs for these are welcome!

## Features / Public interface

Initialize the ForemWebView and treat it as if it were just another WKWebView. An example project is available in this repo.

```swift
webView.navigationDelegate = self
webView.foremWebViewDelegate = self

// Our custom `load(_ urlString: String)` function
webView.load("https://dev.to")

// Once a page is loaded via `.load(...)` the `baseHost` variable
// will remain available for future use
print(webView.baseHost)
```

You're in charge of the `navigationPolicy`, but we provide a few helper methods like `isOAuthUrl` which will help make these decisions. The current interface supports:

- `load(_ urlString: String)`
  - Recommended interface for programmatically loading a URL in the webView
- `isOAuthUrl(_ url: URL) -> Bool`
  - Responds to whether the url provided is one of the supported 3rd party redirect URLs in a OAuth protocol
- `fetchUserStatus(completion: @escaping (String?) -> Void)`
  - Async callback to request the user status (i.e. `logged-in`)
- `fetchUserData(completion: @escaping (ForemUserData?) -> Void)`
  - Async callback to request the `ForemUserData` struct

## Native Podcast Player & Picture in Picture video

In order for your App to take advantage of these native features via the `ForemWebView` you'll need two things:
1. Make sure you enable `Audio, AirPlay, and Pciture in Picture` from the Background Mode capability in your Project's Target
1. Configure the AVAudioSession category to `.playback`, preferrably in your AppDelegate. A one liner that works for this is `try? AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(.playback)`

The podcast player will automatically take advantage of [Background audio](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/media_playback_and_selection/creating_a_basic_video_player_ios_and_tvos/enabling_background_audio) playback. If background playback is unavailable/unsupported the Podcast Player will still play the audio in your App in the foreground. However, when the App is sent to the background you'll be missing better Artwork, controls, and the playback will stop after some time.

## Contributing

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/forem/ForemWebView-ios/issues).

For Pull Requests:
1. Fork and clone the project.
1. Create a branch, naming it either a feature or bug: git checkout -b feature/that-new-feature or bug/fixing-that-bug
1. Code and commit your changes. Bonus points if you write a [good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/): git commit -m 'Add some feature'
1. Push to the branch: git push origin feature/that-new-feature
1. Create a pull request for your branch üéâ

#### Project Tests

The tests are run using the Example app bundled in the project. You can use XCode to run the test suite or from a Terminal with the following command:

```bash
# Make sure the `destination` param is using an iOS/Simulator available in your local development
set -o pipefail && xcodebuild -project ForemWebView.xcodeproj -scheme Example -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=14.1,name=iPhone 12 Pro Max' test | xcpretty
```
